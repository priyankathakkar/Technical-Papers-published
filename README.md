# Technical-Papers-published

Published two technical papers in (International Journal of Computer Appliation) IJCA journal while working on
### An Adaptive mechanism for controlling the Routing overhead of AODV

•	Suppressed the overhead caused by the broadcast of control messages used for local link connectivity in MANETs.

•	Modified the original AODV source code in C language and analyzed the performance in QualNet (Network Simulator).

•	The performance of our approach had improved by 22.25%. 

•	Published two international papers to demonstrate our research and implementation.
